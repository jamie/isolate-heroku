This gem will rebuild your .gems file for Heroku to match the current
contents of your Isolate file each time it is loaded.

Recommended installation is:

  # Isolate
  gem "isolate-heroku"

  # early in your app loading cycle
  require "isolate/now"
  require "isolate/heroku"

Note that this plugin will only make changes to your local .gems file,
you still need to commit it yourself.
